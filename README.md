This is the Companion App for [TRIfA](https://github.com/zoff99/ToxAndroidRefImpl) to enable Push Messages via Google FCM.<br>
We have a Development Version that uses [UnifiedPush](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/gotify/) (with Gotify) for Push Messages which works completely without Google.
